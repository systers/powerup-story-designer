## Current State (July 25, 2018)

Best in Chrome. Works in Safari and Firefox. May work in Opera.

**Media assets between this project and the main PowerUp repos will need to be manually kept in sync.**

**Names for the assets need to be identical.**

***

- dependencies
    - [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - for data-reactive front-end
    - [less](http://lesscss.org/) - for cleaner css
    - [jQuery 3](https://api.jquery.com/) - for simplifying dom interactions during development - potentially unnecessary as more management is given to Vue

    - [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) - animations
    - [Noty](https://ned.im/noty/#/) - notifications
    - [SimpleBar](http://grsmto.github.io/simplebar/) - cross-browser customizable scroll bars
***
- hotkeys
    - `ctrl + n` - add a new card
    - `ctrl + z` - undo action
    - `ctrl + y` - redo action
    - `ctrl + s` - save over last saved state
    - `ctrl + d` - prompt download work session file
    - `ctrl + u` - prompt upload work session file
    - `delete` - delete the currently focused card (currently the only way to delete a card)
***
## Basic Functionality
- click the add button to add new cards
- click a card or thumbnail to focus
- new cards default to the `'no change'` setting for image and position fields
    - this means a new card will automatically visualize the image and position from the previous card
    - changing a prior card will auto-update any cards that would be affected due to a `no change` setting
***
## Saved States
- clicking an empty slot and selecting save will prompt you to name the slot, return to save
- after saving, you can save over the same slot without being prompted for confirmation
- if you select a differe but previously filled slot, you will be prompted to confirm your selection
- renaming a slot will not affect the saved state
- loading a slot will load the saved state and close the menu
- select a slot and clicking delete will prompt you for confirmation
***
## Export Menu
- Download
    - this will prompt you to name your work session for download
    - this json file is different from StorySequences.json
        - it stores your current open work and saved states
    - it will download to your normal web downloads folder
- Upload
    - this will open a file dialog where you can select a previously downloaded work session json
    - it will restore your complete session, including current work, current history, and saved states
- Export
    - before selecting this option, fill out the grid in the lower section of the popup
    - you should select saved states that are properly labeled for each intro and outro
    - then, clicking export will export will download StorySequences.json to your normal web downloads folder
        - StorySequences.json is formatted for use in PowerUp, just replace the same file in the project folder
        - it's ok to leave empty fields before exporting, especially for development and testing
